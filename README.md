- **Harmonic mixing** with optional key-based track reordering
- **Audio normalization** to prevent clipping
- **Support for different sample rates** with automatic resampling
- **Modular architecture** for easy customization and extension

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd /Users/andy.mishra/workspace/dj-mix-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **For visual downbeat selection** (`--manual-downbeats`) and **interactive beatgrid alignment** (`--interactive-beats`), you need a GUI backend:

**Option A: tkinter (recommended, usually pre-installed)**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# macOS/Windows: tkinter should already be included
```

**Option B: PyQt5 (alternative)**
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

4. **For audio playback during interactive alignment** (optional but recommended):
```bash
pip install sounddevice
```
This enables the "Play Section" button in the interactive beatgrid alignment tool.

Note: Installing librosa may take a few minutes as it has several dependencies including scipy and scikit-learn.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python dj_mix_generator.py track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

This will:
1. Analyze each track for BPM and key
2. Create seamless 8-measure crossfade transitions (default)
3. Use sequential tempo strategy (first track's BPM)
4. Output a file called `dj_mix.wav`

### Harmonic Mixing (Key-Based Reordering)

```bash
python dj_mix_generator.py --reorder-by-key track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

This will:
1. Analyze each track for BPM and key
2. **Reorder tracks for optimal harmonic compatibility**
3. Create seamless transitions with better key matching
4. Output a file called `dj_mix.wav`

The key matching uses Circle of Fifths relationships:
- **Perfect matches**: Same key or relative major/minor
- **Compatible**: Adjacent keys in Circle of Fifths
- **Semitone**: Keys one semitone apart (energy boost)
- **Clashes**: Avoid awkward key combinations

### Transition Testing (Preview Mode)

```bash
python dj_mix_generator.py --transitions-only track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

This creates a preview file (`dj_transitions_preview.wav`) containing only the transition sections:
- 5 seconds from the end of each track
- Full 30-second transition
- 5 seconds from the start of the next track
- 1-second silence gap between each transition

Perfect for testing downbeat alignment and transition quality before generating the full mix!

### Track Analysis Caching

The tool automatically caches track analysis results to speed up repeated usage:

```bash
# View cache information
python dj_mix_generator.py --cache-info

# Clear all cached analyses
python dj_mix_generator.py --clear-cache

# Clean up orphaned cache files
python dj_mix_generator.py --cleanup-cache

# Disable caching for this run
python dj_mix_generator.py --no-cache track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

**Cache Benefits:**
- **Fast re-analysis**: Previously analyzed tracks load instantly from cache
- **Intelligent identification**: Uses file hash + metadata to detect identical tracks
- **Automatic management**: Cache is stored in `~/.dj_mix_generator_cache/`
- **Safe storage**: Metadata (JSON) and audio data (pickle) stored separately

### Visual Downbeat Selection

For maximum precision, manually select the first downbeat using an interactive waveform:

```bash
python dj_mix_generator.py --manual-downbeats track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

**Interactive Features:**
- **Waveform Display**: Shows first 10 seconds of each track with detected beats
- **Visual Selection**: Click on the waveform where the first downbeat should occur
- **Beat Snapping**: Clicks near detected beats automatically snap for precision
- **Auto-Generation**: Creates regular downbeat pattern from your selection
- **Fallback Options**: Choose automatic detection or cancel if needed

The GUI opens for each track during analysis, allowing you to:
1. See the waveform with detected beats (orange dashed lines)
2. Click where the first downbeat should be (red line shows selection)
3. Choose "Confirm" to use your selection, "Auto-Detect" for automatic, or "Cancel"

Manual selections are cached separately from automatic detection!

### Interactive Beatgrid Alignment

For ultimate precision in beat matching, use **GPU-accelerated** interactive beatgrid alignment:

```bash
python dj_mix_generator.py --interactive-beats track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

```bash
python dj_mix_generator.py --no-volume-matching track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

- **RMS-based normalization**: Matches perceived loudness between tracks
- **Soft limiting**: Prevents clipping while maintaining dynamics
- **Consistent levels**: Eliminates jarring volume changes during transitions
- **Broadcast-ready**: Professional loudness standards for club/radio play

**EQ Matching**
```bash
# Default: 50% EQ matching strength
python dj_mix_generator.py track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav

# Gentle EQ matching (25% strength)
python dj_mix_generator.py --eq-strength=0.25 track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav

# Aggressive EQ matching (75% strength) 
python dj_mix_generator.py --eq-strength=0.75 track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav

# Disable EQ matching entirely
python dj_mix_generator.py --no-eq-matching track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

- **3-band spectral matching**: Low, mid, and high frequency balance

Target spectral balance (L/M/H): 0.40/0.36/0.24
EQ adjustments - Low: +1.2dB, Mid: -0.8dB, High: +0.5dB
Professional audio processing complete!
```

### Tempo Alignment Strategies

Choose between two tempo alignment strategies:

**Sequential Strategy (Default)**
```bash
python dj_mix_generator.py --tempo-strategy=sequential track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

- Each track is stretched to match the **previous track's tempo**
- First track plays at its native BPM
- Final mix BPM = first track's BPM
- Results in gradual tempo changes throughout the mix
- Best for preserving the energy and feel of the opening track

**Uniform Strategy**
```bash
python dj_mix_generator.py --tempo-strategy=uniform track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

- All tracks are stretched to match the **average BPM** of all tracks
- Consistent tempo throughout the entire mix
- Final mix BPM = average of all track BPMs
- Best for maintaining steady energy across the entire set

**Example:**
- Track1: 120 BPM, Track2: 128 BPM, Track3: 132 BPM
- Sequential: Mix plays at 120 BPM (track1's tempo)
- Uniform: Mix plays at 126.7 BPM (average tempo)

### Measure-Based Transitions

Control transition length in musical terms instead of arbitrary time durations:

**Measure-Based (Recommended)**
```bash
python dj_mix_generator.py --transition-measures=16 track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

- Transitions last exactly 16 measures of music
- Automatically calculated duration based on BPM
- Musically meaningful and consistent across different tempos
- Perfect for DJ-style mixing

**Time-Based (Legacy)**
```bash 
python dj_mix_generator.py --transition-seconds=45 track1.wav track2.wav track3.wav
```

- Transitions last exactly 45 seconds
- Same duration regardless of BPM
- Can result in awkward musical timing

**Examples:**
- `--transition-measures=8` (default): 8 measure transitions = 16 seconds at 120 BPM, 12 seconds at 160 BPM
- `--transition-measures=32`: Extended 32 measure transitions = 64 seconds at 120 BPM, 48 seconds at 160 BPM
- `--transition-seconds=30`: Always 30 seconds regardless of tempo

## How It Works

1. **Track Analysis**: Each WAV file is analyzed using librosa to extract:
   - BPM (beats per minute) using onset detection
   - Musical key using chromagram analysis
   - Beat positions for precise alignment
   - Downbeat positions (strong beats marking measure boundaries)

2. **Beat Matching**: When transitioning between tracks:
   - Time-stretches the incoming track to match the current tempo
   - Preserves pitch while adjusting speed

3. **Enhanced Downbeat Detection**: Optimized for kick drums and percussion:
   - Separates percussive and harmonic content using HPSS (Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation)
   - Analyzes low-frequency content (60-120 Hz) for kick drum detection
   - Uses spectral flux analysis for percussive onset detection
   - Combines multiple metrics with weighted scoring system
   - Pattern validation using autocorrelation for consistent measure detection
   
4. **Intelligent Tempo Correction**: Eliminates beat drift:
   - **Piecewise time-stretching**: Stretches audio segments between detected beats
   - **Perfect tempo consistency**: Maintains exact BPM throughout entire track duration
   - **Manual tempo support**: Respects user-defined BPM from manual downbeat selection
   - **Drift elimination**: Prevents tempo variations from accumulating over track length

5. **Perfect Beat Alignment**: Professional DJ-style transitions:
   - Finds optimal outro point in current track (ending on downbeat)
   - Finds optimal intro point in next track (starting on downbeat) 
   - **Micro-stretching**: Applies piecewise time-stretching between beat markers
   - **Beat-by-beat alignment**: Every single beat matches throughout the transition
   - **Sub-5ms precision**: Achieves professional-level timing accuracy

6. **Crossfading**: Creates smooth transitions using:
   - Equal-power crossfade curves (cosine/sine)
   - 30-second default transition duration
   - Beat-aligned segments for seamless mixing

7. **Audio Processing**: 
   - Handles different sample rates via resampling
   - Normalizes final output to prevent clipping
   - Maintains audio quality throughout the process

## Limitations

This is a basic implementation with some limitations:

- **Simple key detection**: Uses basic chromagram analysis (not as accurate as professional tools)
- **Basic downbeat detection**: Uses spectral analysis but may not be 100% accurate for complex music
- **Fixed crossfade**: Uses simple equal-power crossfades (no EQ matching or advanced techniques)
- **Time signature assumption**: Assumes 4/4 time signature for downbeat detection
- **WAV only**: Currently only supports WAV files

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modular components:

- `models.py` - Track dataclass definition
- `audio_analyzer.py` - AudioAnalyzer class for BPM, key detection, and downbeat analysis
- `beat_utils.py` - BeatAligner class for precise downbeat alignment
- `mix_generator.py` - MixGenerator class for beat-aligned transitions and mixing  
- `key_matcher.py` - KeyMatcher class for harmonic mixing and track reordering
- `track_cache.py` - TrackCache class for persistent analysis caching
- `dj_mix_generator.py` - Main DJMixGenerator class and CLI interface
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps for Enhancement

- Better key detection algorithms (Krumhansl-Schmuckler, etc.)
- Advanced harmonic mixing algorithms (considering energy levels, mood)
- Automatic cue point detection for optimal transition timing
- EQ matching between tracks
- Support for MP3 and other audio formats
- GUI interface for easier use
- Advanced time-stretching with pyrubberband
- Machine learning for better track ordering based on user preferences

## Troubleshooting

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'librosa'"**
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**"Error analyzing track.wav: Input file is empty"**
- Make sure your WAV files are valid and not corrupted
- Try converting the file with a tool like ffmpeg if needed

**"No valid tracks loaded!"**
- Check that your file paths are correct
- Ensure WAV files are readable and in a supported format

**Very long processing time**
- Large audio files take time to analyze
- Consider using shorter clips for testing
- BPM detection is the most time-consuming step

**"No working GUI backend found" or "tkinter not installed"**
- Install tkinter: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` (Ubuntu/Debian)
- Alternative: `pip install PyQt5` 
- Visual downbeat selection and interactive beatgrid alignment require a GUI backend
- The tool will automatically fall back to automatic detection

**"Audio playback not available" during interactive alignment**
- Install sounddevice: `pip install sounddevice`
- On Linux, you may also need: `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-dev`
- Audio playback is optional - alignment still works without it
- The "Play Section" button helps with precise manual alignment

## Example Test

To test with your own tracks:

```bash
# Basic mixing (preserves original order)

python dj_mix_generator.py --manual-downbeats --reorder-by-key --tempo-strategy=uniform --transition-measures=12 your_track1.wav your_track2.wav

# Ultimate precision: manual downbeats + interactive beatgrid alignment
python dj_mix_generator.py --manual-downbeats --interactive-beats --transition-measures=8 your_track1.wav your_track2.wav

# Output files: dj_mix.wav (full mix) or dj_transitions_preview.wav (transitions only)
```
